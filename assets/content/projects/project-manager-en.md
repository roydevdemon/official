Parabara is a platform where you can safely buy and sell used items without meeting anyone face-to-face. Sellers just list their items on the app and drop them off at a nearby Parabox (vending machine) close to home or work. Buyers can check items right away and pick them up with a card payment, no sign-up needed. It solves both the safety worries of meeting in person and the trust issues of delivery.
